# Mindee's Zapier Integrations

At [Mindee](https://mindee.com), we recently launched a no-code versions of our ‘off the shelf’ APIs ([invoice](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/invoice-ocr), [receipt](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/receipt-ocr) and [passport](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/passport-ocr) OCR) as a part of the [Zapier](https://zapier.com) platform. Zapier is a no code platform that allows for easy integration between literally thousands of different applications or services - with no, or a very little code.

Zapier’s automations are known as ‘zaps’, and they have a trigger that begins the Zap - creating a series of actions that follow one another. Our three APIs (invoice, passport and receipt) are Zapier actions. The typical trigger is “a new file has arrived",  now extract the data with Mindee. Now that you have the data extracted by Mindee, you can use the data however you want. Read Zapier documentation on [how to create your zap](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/create-zaps).
